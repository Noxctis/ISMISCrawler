### ISMIS Crawler by Zach Riane Machacon

## Context
Recently, I've been fascinated by the concept of webscraping using Python. Therefore, I will be using it to my advantage to solve my laziness by letting a script view my grades for me. 

## Current ideas
I'm planning to use Selenium through a headless Chromium webdriver to do authentication for me and accessing the grades URL itself. The grades are enclosed in tables which could be parsed by the script easily with a bit of experimentation.
